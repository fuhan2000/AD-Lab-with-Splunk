# AD-Lab-with-Splunk

## Objective
In this project, we have set up one Active Directory Server, one Windows 10 PC, a Kali Linux that simulates an attacker, and a Splunk server running on Ubuntu.

The project is based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR">@MyDFIR</a> Active Directory Project (Home Lab).

### Tools Used
- VirtualBox
- Sysmon
- Splunk
- Active Directory
- Kali Linux's crowbar
- Ubuntu
- Atomic Red Team
- Mitre Att&ck

### Network Diagram

*Ref 1: Network Diagram*

All four VMs are in the same 192.168.100/24 network and are hosted in Virtualbox.

Each VM has access to the internet.

The attacker, positioned at Kali Linux (192.168.100.250), represents a potential threat to the network's security.

The AD Server and Windows 10 will have:
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Sysmon

Splunk Server will be at 192.168.100.10 and will run on Ubuntu.

### Summary of Findings
- The timezone settings of the VMs to be monitored are essential. In this Lab, the AD Server and Windows 10 are set to the Singapore time zone. If the timezones are incorrect, the wrong datetime may be reported to Splunk, which can complicate analysis.

- Crowbar uses brute force. In this Lab, only 21 passwords are used to save time. Using a passphrase can reduce the risk of brute-force attacks. The victim here, tsmith, uses a common password.

- Splunk can be used to detect brute-force attacks (many Windows Event Code 4625 within a very short timeframe) and determine where they originated.

- Atomic Red Team has a library of tests mapped to the Mitre Att&ck framework. Splunk can detect those telemetries in the T1136.001 Create Local Account and T1059.001 Powershell tests.

## Lab Details
### Virtualbox NAT Network Settings

*Ref 2: NAT Networks ADProject configuration*

ADProject has an IPv4 Prefix of 192.168.100.0/24.

*Ref 3: Windows 10 NAT Network*

All VMs are attached to the NAT Network and still have internet access. However, inÂ Ref 3, only the settings for Windows 10 are shown.

### Time Zone Settings
Do check the timezone settings of:
- AD Server
- Windows 10

As I am located in Singapore, these are my settings:

*Ref 5: Windows 10 Timezone*

*Ref 6: Ubuntu Timezone*

Setting the Ubuntu (Splunk) server to use UTC is okay.

*Ref 7: Kali Timezone*

I decided to use Singapore timezone for Kali.

### Sysmon

Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR">@MyDFIR</a>'s Youtube instructions at Active Directory Project (Home Lab) | Part 3.

He uses a sysmon config from Olaf Hartong's <a href="https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular">Github</a>.

### Splunk

Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR">@MyDFIR</a>'s Youtube instructions at 
- Active Directory Project (Home Lab) | Part 3 for Ubuntu, Windows 10, AD Server

Splunk Enterprise will be installed at Ubuntu.

Splunk Universal Forwarder will be installed on Windows 10 and AD Server.

*Ref 8: Two hosts visible to Splunk* 

If you have configured everything correctly, Splunk should see two hosts (TARGET-PC and ADDC01).

### Using Crowbar against Windows 10's RDP

*Ref 9: Attacker's password.txt* 

The attacker has this password.txt and will launch an attack on Windows 10's RDP. 


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/u8ePjs1.jpg" width="300" />

*Ref 10: Attacker issues the crowbar command* 

In Ref 10, the attacker manages to crack tsmith's RDP password to the Windows 10 PC.

*Ref 11: Telemetry on Splunk* 

This attack has generated this telemetry on Splunk. Twenty-three events are seen for index = endpoint tsmith.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EJK7hV6.jpg" width="400" />

*Ref 12: Windows Event Codes*

There are twenty counts of EventCode 4625 and one of 4624.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oZpTreU.jpg" width="400" />

*Ref 13: Windows Event Code 4625*

According to <a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4625">Ultimate Windows Security</a>, 4625 indicates, "An account failed to log on".

4624 is "An account was successfully logged on".

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VoR28F5.jpg" width="400" />

*Ref 14: Splunk information on Kali*

If you use index=endpoint tsmith EventCode=4625 and scroll down, you will see Kali, as seen in Ref 14.

### Atomic Red Team
